# Disease models

Models for cucumber, hemp and cabbage.

In each folder you can find the data I used, and the python notebooks files.

- `data___.xls/csv` files are the inputs for the models.
- `res___.xls/csv` files are the outputs for the models.
- `obs___.xls/csv` files are the observations made by the  on the inputs for the models.

## Documentation

There are the states of the art in the `docs` folder.

## Python notebooks

For the notebooks we used the Jupyter notebooks. 

If you want to use them to change the current data used or run the code by yourself, you can go in the `jupyter-installation.md` file to know how to install and use it. Contact `dylan.mamie@master.hes-so.ch` if you have any problems with the tutorial.

If you don't want to install the notebooks, you can consult the result of the `.ipynb` files directly in the github repository but you won't be able to modify them. You can also look at the `res____.xls/csv` files to see the results we currently have.
