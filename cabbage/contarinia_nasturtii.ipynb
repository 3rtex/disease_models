    "The accumulation of DD in the Contapré model (Bouma, 1996) begins when the daily maximum soil temperature at 5cm depth exceeds 20 °C and ≥11 mm of rain follows within 3 days (M Vlaswinkel, pers. comm.). First flight of swede midge was predicted to occur when thermal accumulations(C) exceeded that required for necessary insect development to occur, and was described by the following equation of the Contapré model:\n",
    "\n",
    "C = $\\sum_{t} (T_t - T_0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where t = time (days), T = mean daily temperature at soil depth of 5 cm (°C), and T0 = base threshold of development (7.2 °C). C is calculated daily and summed to the previous day’s value. When C reaches 160 DD, adult emergence should occur. Successive flights occur when C again reaches 160 DD. In addition, if the mean daily temperature over 2 days falls below 15 °C, flight is delayed until the mean daily temperature rises above this value; and, if more than 25 mm of precipitation falls between 135–160 DD, adult flight will occur immediately (M Vlaswinkel, pers. comm.). \n",
